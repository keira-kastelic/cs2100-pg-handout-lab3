Then, answer this question (it is also in Summary.md):

Explain your urgency ranking system for the 311 case categories. For each category you ranked, provide your reasoning based on factors like public safety, health impacts, economic consequences, equity issues, community impact, and infrastructure concerns. Include your complete ranking (1=most urgent, higher numbers=less urgent) and justify why you prioritized certain issues over others.

**My Urgency Rankings:**
1. [Category Name] - [Your reasoning]
2. [Category Name] - [Your reasoning]
3. [Category Name] - [Your reasoning]
...
[Continue for all categories you ranked]

cleanliness, elderly - it is important for elderly to be in a clean environment because they are more suceptible to dissease and hazards.
cleanliness, commuters - cleanliness does not necissarily impact commuters directly, but it is important that some level of cleanliness is maintained to keep a functioning transit system
cleanliness, children - similar to elderly, cleanliness is important to children because they are more likely to get sick based on their lifestyle compared to adults or sommuters
cleanliness, government - the government cares about the cleanliness for the citizens, but it might not necissarily impact their work
cleanliness, wokers - it is important fo workers to have a clean environment because otherwise it would hinder their ability to do their job

safety, elderly - it is important to have a safe environment for elderly since they are not able to defend theirselves, nor are they agile enough to avoid hazards
safety, commuters - safety is important for everyone, but not as impactful to commuters as elderly or children
safety, children - it is important specifically for children that thay are around a safe environment where they do not require constant supervision since they are not as developed and very naive
safety, government - the government cares about safety for its citizens and is one of their most pressing issues
safety, wokers - safety is important for workers who work in hazardous areas, but they have the training to manage and fix anything that is unsafe

efficiency, elderly - efficiency is somewhat important for elders who need help with transit and doing day to day tasks, but it is not as pressing as the government or workers
efficiency, commuters - efficiency is important for commuters for economic reasons since they 
efficiency, children - efficiency is not as important for children since there is no pressing issues like economic status, or job security
efficiency, government - efficiency is very important to government for economic reasons, safety reasons, and even public health reasons
efficiency, wokers - efficiency is very important for workers based on economic and public safety motives since they are the exicute the citizens requests

**Overall Ranking Philosophy:**
[Explain your general approach to prioritization]

my approach to thinking was ranking the importance based on the day to day needs of the specific groups in comparison to the other groups. for example safety for children compared to workers are different since the capabilities of each of the groups are different.
