You're working on a Python calculator project with a teammate.
You've just finished implementing a `divide()` function in `calculator.py`.
Before `git push`ing your new function, you `git pull` any changes that your teammate made, and it says there is a merge conflict because your teammate added a `multiply()` function in `calculator.py`.

What can you do to resolve the conflict and complete the merge?

you could copy your code over to a seperate file and fetch the partners current version. Once everything is up to date, you could add your code to the updated version and continue to work on it.
